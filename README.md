# Project 1: Newbie at CUHK(SZ) 

Newbie at CUHK(SZ) is a 3D game featuring a voxelized version of our campus. It is developed by the undergraduates of our laboratory for half a year. Through an open world based RPG story, the life of a freshman here is presented to the players. The player will explore the campus, communicate with the staff, and finish missions as a “newbie” of our university. During gameplay, the player will get familiar with the life and study in CUHK(SZ). The missions contain greetings from presidents and deans, interesting stories circulated among students, photography quests testing player’s eyesight, and so on. We hope that this game can help freshmen get used to the campus quickly and promote our university to the public.

# Project 2: Digital Twin of CUHK(SZ)

The project is to build the blockchain-driven digital twin of CUHK(SZ) campus for crowd intelligence research and demonstration. We elaborate the project with techniques of human-computer interaction, computer networks, distributed computing and game theory.
